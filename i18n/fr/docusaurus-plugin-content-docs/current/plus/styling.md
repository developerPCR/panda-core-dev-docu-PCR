# Styling 

Panda Plus  uses tailwind for the majority of styles withing the template, which gives you a lot of flexibility to modify and change things.

we also have a css file which has some global css classes needed which is called `styles/global.css`

:::tip

If you want to extend **classes** use `styles/custom.css` so you can get updates from our templates without too much conflicts.
