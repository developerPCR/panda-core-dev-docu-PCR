# Decide my Template

There are multiple templates and designs combinations that you can choose.

:::caution
We dont have access to your project in anyway, all you will have is the Panda Template, Google Functions and Documentation to setup all the other services.

So you will have no dependency with us by using our system.

Support is always available for the Panda Templates.
:::

:::info

All template features are fully functional, they are not just templates and we have full support until you have it working.

Usually takes less than 2 hours to have your page working with all the configs, users and payments.
