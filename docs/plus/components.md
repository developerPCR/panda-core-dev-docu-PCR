# UI components

<h2>We made a common list of components that you can use to achieve your needs. All dark/light mode compatible.</h2>

You can check all components in our [Storybook](https://ui-kit.blue-panda.dev/?path=/docs/example-introduction--docs).

:::tip
if you are building components, be sure you style them by using the correct `dark:` preffix for tailwind classes.
