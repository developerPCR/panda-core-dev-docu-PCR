# Store Managment 

<h2>Lightweight for your project!</h2>

We use a very lightweight store manager which is [Jotai](https://jotai.org), just for some loading statuses and global things.

:::tip
Avoid installing redux, brings a lot of boilerplate, if you want to have an store manager, most of the time **jotai** will do the job, in case you need more flexibility you can also use [Zustand](https://zustand-demo.pmnd.rs/)
