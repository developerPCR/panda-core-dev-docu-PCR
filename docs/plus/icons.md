# Icons 

<h2>Please check out and choose your icons</h2>

We have included [react icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/) which has a vast amount of icons available (tree shaking capable).


Simple to use:

```jsx
import { FaBeer } from 'react-icons/fa';
class Question extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h3> Lets go for a <FaBeer />? </h3>
  }
}

```
