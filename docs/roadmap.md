# Current Roadmap 

<h2>We would like to bring a lot more posibilities to our users</h2>, so we are constantly creating new integrations and templates.

:::info

What is nice is that in case you buy a Firebase template (Integrations for having users in your app) 
and in the future you want to either have a CMS integrated or Stripe, would be quite simple to integrate that into your app.
:::

Before we even show this into public, we are creating at least 4 micro saas to validate our template and improve thins along the road.
